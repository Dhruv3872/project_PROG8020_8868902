What I will build:
Redundant Electronic hardware pickup request system:
Pages:
1. Home page for a user to submit a request.- done.
2. Thank you page for the user once the request is submitted.- done.
3. Admin login page where the admin will put his/her login credentials.- done.
I think that you can hardcode that for now since you don't need to save 
the credentials in mongodb.
4. Dashboard for the admin once logged in.- done.
5. View page rendered if clicked on any of the requests.- done.
6. Edit page rendered if clicked on 'Edit' button of any of the requests.- done.
7. Thank you page rendered once the request is edited.- done.
8. Thank you page rendered once the request is deleted.- done.

Admin username: thisIsAdmin
password: Admin'sFavouritePassword
