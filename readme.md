What I will build:
Redundant Electronic hardware pickup request system:
Pages:
1. Home page for a user to submit a request.
2. Thank you page for the user once the request is submitted.
3. Admin login page where the admin will put his/her login credentials.
I think that you can hardcode that for now since you don't need to save 
the credentials in mongodb.
4. Dashboard for the admin once logged in.
5. View page rendered if clicked on any of the requests.
6. Edit page rendered if clicked on 'Edit' button of any of the requests.
7. Thank you page rendered once the request is edited.
8. Thank you page rendered once the request is deleted.
